to function as a railway terminal, and by 1986, it was transformed into the Musée d' Orsay, a museum dedicated to art from Impressionist and Post-Impressionist movements. The building itself is a considered an architectural masterpiece, with a vast, open central hall and a glass roof, adding to its historical significance.</p>
